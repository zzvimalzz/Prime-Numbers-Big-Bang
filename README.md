# Prime-Numbers-Big-Bang

## The problem
There was a tale when 2 prime numbers collided and a big bang happened. Scientists found out
the 2 prime numbers are 3 and 5 but they need a model to generate an array of numbers to
predict when the big bang will happen again.

## Description
This project includes a JavaScript file (`script.js`) that iterates through the numbers 1 to 100, replacing numbers divisible by 3 with "BIG", by 5 with "BANG", and by both 3 and 5 with "BIG BANG".

## Requirements
Ensure that yoiu have Node.js installed on your machine.
Clone this repository.

## Running
- Using Command Line/Command Prompt navigate to the project directory using 'cd'.
